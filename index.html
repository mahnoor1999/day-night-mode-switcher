                Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept. <br>
                When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally. You think: “I’m gonna need
                a
                variable here,” and add it to your code. <br>
                Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they have already used them
                unknowingly
                many times — and it is likely that this is true for yourself, too. So learning closures is less about
                understanding a new concept and more about recognizing something you have already been doing for a
                while.

            <h3>tl;dr</h3>
            <p>
                You have a closure when <strong> a function accesses variables defined outside of it.
                </strong>

            </p>
            <p>For example, this code snippet contains a closure:</p>
           <code> let users = ['Alice', 'Dan', 'Jessica'];
            let query = 'A';
            let user = users.filter(user => user.startsWith(query));</code>
            <p>
                Notice how user => user.startsWith(query) is itself a function. It uses the query variable. But the
                query
                variable is defined outside of that function. That’s a closure.
            </p>

                You can stop reading here, if you want. The rest of this article approaches closures in a different way.
                Instead
                of explaining what a closure is, it will walk you through the process of discovering closures — like the
                first
                programmers did in the 1960s.

            <h3>Step 1: Functions Can Access Outside Variables</h3>
            <p>
                To understand closures, we need to be somewhat familiar with variables and functions. In this example,
                we
                declare the food variable inside the eat function:
            </p>
            <code>let users = ['Alice', 'Dan', 'Jessica'];
                let query = 'A';
                let user = users.filter(user => user.startsWith(query));</code>
            <h3>Step 2: Functions Can Access Outside Variables</h3>
            <p>
                To understand closures, we need to be somewhat familiar with variables and functions. In this example,
                we
                declare the food variable inside the eat function:
            </p>
            <code>let users = ['Alice', 'Dan', 'Jessica'];
                let query = 'A';
                let user = users.filter(user => user.startsWith(query));</code>
